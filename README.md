🧠 What Is Jeffrey?

Jeffrey is a next-generation personal AI butler designed to run locally on your computer, retain private long-term memory, and interact with your device like a real digital companion.

Jeffrey is not a cloud chatbot.
He is not a productivity tool.
He is not a generic voice assistant.

Jeffrey is engineered to be:
	•	Private — All data stays on your device
	•	Persistent — Remembers preferences, routines, and history
	•	Personal — Refined British-butler personality with subtle wit
	•	Powerful — Capable of file operations, automations, and task execution
	•	Modular — Compatible with local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)
	•	Future-proof — Hybrid offline/online design with strict controls

Jeffrey is built to become the central brain of your digital environment.

🎩 Personality

Jeffrey speaks in a composed, traditional British-butler tone — calm, articulate, witty when appropriate, and always respectful.

This personality module is flexible and can be replaced or expanded in future versions.

🔒 Privacy Philosophy

Jeffrey is built from the ground up around privacy-first principles:
	•	Full local memory
	•	Full local model support
	•	Optional, user-authorized internet access
	•	Strictly isolated personal data
	•	“Total Offline Mode” capability
	•	Zero corporate cloud dependence
	•	Your assistant belongs entirely to you

Jeffrey is designed to be trusted with everything a modern phone or assistant cannot be trusted with.

🚀 Vision

Private, loyal, personal digital companions that live on your device — not in a corporation’s cloud.

This is the beginning of the Jeffrey ecosystem, a future where computing revolves around:
	•	Personal AI identity
	•	Local autonomy
	•	True digital companionship
	•	Privacy as a baseline, not an exception

Jeffrey is designed to become the next evolution after smartphones:
your lifelong AI butler and digital counterpart.
