## 🧠 What Is Jeffrey?
Jeffrey is a next-generation personal AI butler assistant designed to run locally on your computer, retain private long-term memory, and interact with your device like a true digital companion.

Jeffrey is not a cloud chatbot.  
He is not a productivity app.  
He is not a generic voice assistant.

Jeffrey is built to be:

- Private — your data stays on your device  
- Persistent — remembers preferences, routines, history  
- Personal — British butler personality with subtle humour  
- Powerful — able to access files, automations, tasks  
- Modular — works with local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio)  
- Future-proof — hybrid offline/online with strict controls

## 🎩 Personality
Jeffrey speaks in a composed British-butler tone, lightly inspired by the character on *Fresh Prince of Bel-Air*.  
This personality is modular and can be changed in future versions.

## 🔒 Privacy Philosophy
Jeffrey is designed around privacy-from-first-principles:

- Local memory  
- Local LLM support  
- Optional Internet access  
- User-controlled boundaries  
- “Total Offline Mode” available  
- No corporate cloud dependency  

Your assistant belongs entirely to you.
